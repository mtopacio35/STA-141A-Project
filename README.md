# STA-141A-Project
This project for tackles the goal of building a predictive model for the outcome of trials involving mice and visual stimuli that triggered neuron activity in their visual cortices. In this report, we take the steps of exploring the data through summary tables and plots, integrating the data by extracting patterns across sessions and assessing potential differences, and finally creating a predictive model through which we apply the test data to for evaluation. The findings from the evaluation yielded a relatively high predictive model accuracy, proving the efficiency of our model in terms of predictive capabilities.
